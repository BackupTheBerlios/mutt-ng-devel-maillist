Subject: mutt-ng in the FreeBSD ports tree
Message-ID: <20070408221131.GB8935@tcbug.org>

I recently took over maintainership of the mutt-ng port in the 
FreeBSD ports tree and I have a couple of questions.

1) The last snapshot I could find is from November....has development 
or snapshots stopped?

2) The port is currently using a snapshot from September...would it 
be of value to upgrade the port to use the latest snapshot?

Thanks,
