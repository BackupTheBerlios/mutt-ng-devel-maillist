Hi all,

I managed to get the sidebar patch working very well upon Christoph
Berg's Debian mutt package. I had to disabled the maildir-mtime
patch, 'cause the sidebar patch made it impossible to work with
nfs shared maildirs. As well I enabled the indexcolor included in
debian/patches/not-applied, added [0] and [1].

The sidebar patch [2] is slightly changed to match Myon's patches.

Is there no one interessted out there to apply sidebar upstream?
