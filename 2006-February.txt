Subject: allow_ansi fix
Message-ID: <20060202221152.GA11080@kos.local>

Hi.

I'm not sure if I must post it here or in mutt ML, but since I'm using 
mutt-ng I've decided to start here.

Both mutt-1.5.11 and mutt-ng-20050814 (from Gentoo ebuild) don't 
correctly work with allow_ansi option: codes "[39m" (set foreground to 
defaut) and "[49m" (set background to default) ignore terminal settings 
and always use white and black colors respecitvely. Also, if only 
foreground color is set, background color stays initialized with 0 
instead of default color. The same happens if only background color is 
specified, foreground stays 0. It isn't noticable when using default 
white-on-black terminal, but doesn't look too nice in a different color 
scheme.

Here's my attempt to fix the problem:

brief comments: fg and bg colors are initialized with -2 from the very
beginning. -2 is COLOR_DEFAULT from color.c (should be probably moved to 
color.h) When back- or foreground colorcode is spotted, we check if it 
is an attempt to set a default color and change bg/fg value only when 
needed.

Dear Friend,

 
I got your contact on my private search for a reliable
and trusted person to handle a transaction of this
nature. I know that the contents of this mail might
sound so strange, but I want to assure you that every
word of it is true.I am Mr Daniel Chin, credit officer
of the AFC Merchant Bank.I have a concealed business
suggestion for you.Before the plane crash of
Macedonian's President and his Cabinet Members on
February 26, 2004 , our Client Mile Krstevsk from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Macedonia and also a
Business Man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18
calendar months, with a value of Nine Million,Six
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars($9.6Million)
only in my branch.You can visit this website:
 
http://antiwar.com/deliso/?articleid=2043
 
After his death it was also discovered that Mile
Krstevsk did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank
deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he
was at my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my Bank.So, Nine Million,Six Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my
Bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.
What bothers me most is that according to the to the
laws of my country at the expiration of 2years the
funds will revert to the ownership of  the Singapore
Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is
that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to Mile Krstevsk so that you will be able
to receive his funds.
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successfully.I have
contacted an Attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Mile Krstevsk ,all that is required from you at this
stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names
and Address so that the Attorney can commence his
job.After you have been made the next of kin,The
Attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf
and secure the necessary approvals and letter of
Authority in your favor for the move of the funds to
an account that will be provided by you.There is no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to
adopt a legalized method and the Attorney will prepare
all the necessary documents according to the
International Banking Laws.
 
Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all
matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank 
account we shall share in the ratio of 75% for me, 20%
for you and 5%for any expenses incurred during the
course of this operation.Should you be 
interested please send me your private phone and fax
numbers for easy communication, you can write me via
my private box thus:(  daniel_chi at gawab.com  )and i will
provide you with more details of this Project.
 
Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,

Mr Daniel Chin.

Mmmm, mime_lookupisn't listed in muttng -t | grep mime. You're right
the source related to grep mime_lookup source tree is identical.

I'll forward this to upstream.

As the space to empty header fields is always added regardless of 
$edit_headers, my suggestion to simply remove the space in all cases. 
IMHO special treatment for format=flowed only doesn't make sense.

I'll go ahead removing it for all cases... except someone comes up with 
a really good point for why the space is important. Opinions?

          saved width in sidebar.c any longer and using SidebarWidth
          conditionally in all other places) (fixes some more sidebar issues

Severity: normal

-- Please type your report below this line

On my iBook G3 900 w/ Mac OS X 10.4.5, muttng will never allow the
system to sleep unless compiled w/ --enable-buffy-size. Compiled with
the latter, mailboxes that previously received new mail are listed as
having new mail even though this is not true.

In comparison, mutt 1.5.11 vvv-patch shows the mailbox behavior
described above when compiled WITHOUT --enable-buffy-size, and there
are no sleep problems at all.

Thanks for the fix, I'll include it tomorrow if I have time since I need 
to fix a minor issue with it (when in pager mode, last_line must be 1 higher 
as the status bar isn't drawn full-width but only with the width of the pager)

... unless status_on_top=yes ...

oh, ok.
my macro bindings make that difficult...
whenever I enter the pager, the sidebar is hidden automagically...

anyways, just add one line there:
 int last_line = LINES -
 	((option (OPTSTATUSONTOP) && !option (OPTHELP))
	? 1 : 2 -(menu == MENU_PAGER));

I'm curious if this may be related to an issue I'm seeing. With the
following settings:

set help=yes
set status_on_top=yes
set sidebar_width=25
set sidebar_visible=yes

...whenever I am in the pager, the message status line (which normally
shows sender, subject and perhaps a few other things that I'm
forgetting right now) is drawn, but blank. Toggling sidebar_visible
doesn't seem to have any effect on this.

Also, in the attachment menu, it sidebar width is not considered so
the MIME type etc. gets pushed off the edge of the screen. Toggling
the sidebar is a simple, but dirty fix.

This is all with muttng revision 781.

Hmm. What does 'blank' mean? In the right background color but no 
content? Can you post a (portion of a) screenshot URL?

This is fixed, thanks for mentioning. There may well be more of such 
cases...

it still does not work :(
e.g. when in the index (not pager).

since this is not the first problem in sidebar scrolling, it seem
difficult to get it right for all possible 8 modes.

so here is a table which I hope is correct:

menu == pager | status_on_top | help || first_line | last_line | lines
           0  |      no       |  no  ||     0      | LINES-2   | LINES-2
           0  |      no       | yes  ||     1      | LINES-2   | LINES-3
           0  |     yes       |  no  ||     1      | LINES-1   | LINES-2
           0  |     yes       | yes  ||     1      | LINES-2   | LINES-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           1  |      no       |  no  ||     0      | LINES-1   | LINES-1
           1  |      no       | yes  ||     1      | LINES-1   | LINES-2
           1  |     yes       |  no  ||     1      | LINES-1   | LINES-2
           1  |     yes       | yes  ||     1      | LINES-2   | LINES-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

since we now got the first_line and last_line right in sidebar_draw
(I think), calc_boundaries needs to be fixed.  I suggest the patch below.

cheers,
	Lars

r785 tries to fix one more issue, maybe the same?

What I'm wondering all the time now may reduce the table size. With 
$status_on_top=false, why is that the status for the pager is the same 
width as the pager, i.e. the sidebar goes down to the message line? Or 
the other way round: when it makes sense to have the pager status as 
wide as the pager itself, doesn't it make sense for the index and other 
menus as well?

Opinion?


>since we now got the first_line and last_line right in sidebar_draw

Your patch is against 784 and I'll not commit it unless you still have 
trouble with r785. Reason: there alreasy is known_lines globally so 
calculating the lines again in calc_boundaries() isn't necessary. Also, 
the diff from 784-785 stops re-calculating the boundary at every display 
update (...since the calculation is only needed upon sidebar moves).

everything that makes it easier is good.  I don't see a reason to
make a difference between index and pager for this. would also
avoid "strange" jumps in the sidebar display when you change from
pager to index and back.

seems like we have hacked at the same time, I obviously did svn up
before I made that patch...

indeed, I still have problems, though very obscure ones.
but the same that I had when I tried to fix it in the same way
(assign to known_lines directly).
the problem is a little hard to reproduce, it takes several attempts,
and I do not see the pattern yet.

the problem is this:
	go in the pager, scroll the sidebar randomly
	go back in the index, scroll the sidebar
	repeat.

sometimes (every some 20th try or so) the sidebar part of the statusbar
now gets overprinted by a unreachable folder name. once it happens,
it happens repeatedly with different folder names. the statusbar itself
won't be redrawn because it does not suspect it has been damaged.
it seem to depend on the exact position in the sidebar befor going
to pager mode the first time (???)

this did not occur with my patch (not yet, maybe).
if I hit this again and happen to be more awake than just now,
I'll try to track it down to something more specific...

The patch moves the pager status line right by $sidebar_width cells in 
the first screen line. But: from (0,0) to (0,$sidebar_width) the screen 
is left blank which looks ugly with colors.

I still have no input on whether we wan't to always adjust all status 
line to the actual width of the screen exlcluding the sidebar. For 
example, with and without the patch, the pager status line is still the 
only status line being as wide as the pager. The index status line is 
full-screen and not as wide as the index screen. ;-((

That's what I'd like to see solved... since for the problem I don't know 
the best place to fix the blanks: within the sidebar or within the 
pager?

Can we please talk about how to align all status lines first?

   bye, Rocco

I saw someone talking on IRC about it (was that you? ;-). But I must say 
I really hate the idea of adding a variable "just" for this issue.

Another try: does it help if you change 'buffy_check(1)' to 
'buffy_check(0)'? That would let muttng use it's ordinary $mail_check 
and $imap_mail_check timeouts. Still the problem could happen but there 
likely are more places where muttng is not primarily active so we could 
need more variables for all these types of situations which I'd like to 
avoid.

Can you please try 'buffy_check(0)' and report back?

   bye, Rocco

in the first screen shot, find the line where you think the

no. it moves the pager status line from (0,0) (where it does not belong)
to (statusoffset,SW) (where I think it does belong).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

(remember, some of us set pager_index_lines to values != 0)

Yeah, now I see what the problem is. If you set $pager_index_lines to 0 
and try your patch with colors you'll the gap I meant.

Still we need to know if we want to exclude the sidebar in general, i.e. 
move all status lines to right to bypass $sidebar_width...

I did already, and I suggest move(statusoffset, statusoffset ? SW : 0)
for the moment being. I'd sent a new patchlet,
but as it seems, you first have to make up your mind about:

> Still we need to know if we want to exclude the sidebar in general,
> i.e. move all status lines to right to bypass $sidebar_width...

in my opinion, sidebar should be sidebar, and all status lines should
start right of it. which coincidentally makes many offset calculations
much easier... but thats just me.

Hi,

we're currently have some trouble regarding status lines when the 
sidebar is enabled. The status line for the pager is treated specially 
since it's the only one always supposed to start next to the sidebar.

Personally I'd like to have consistent behavior. Either we always start 
next to the sidebar for all kinds of status lines or we start all of 
them at the very left of the screen.

I want to have all of them next to the sidebar.

Opinions?

Hi Rocco,

Yeap - it was me :-)

Ok - I will give a try to not forcing check with 0, which indeed sounds
more logical and 'uniform' way to handle this situation.
...
ok - I gave it a try -- and it works nice (why the heck I've decided to
"Fix" things in the middle of the night? :-)).

Also I believe that there are quite a few other places with forced
buffy_check which cause slow-downs some times... if it only was possible
to buffy_check in the background - oberserver-like separation, so there
is a thread which checks for new emails  and "subjscribed" UI gets
updated whenever check is completed and if there is new emails at
all. That would eliminate the nasty delay.

The design currently is everything but ready for such a transition... 
;-((

But looking for other places of buffy_check([12]) sounds reasonable.

Sorry for the noise, but I committed the update in r790 as one or the 
other may have seen already.

I tried to test under some circumstances but am sure I forgot some since 
there're so many variables ($status_on_top, $help, $pager_index_lines, 
etc.)

Please report back if everything looks like it's supposed to; if not, 
please include at least the values for the mentioned options...

The help-line alway left margined will look perfect then;) It's like
reading a Dokument: Start reading a page at the left is the intuitiv
intention. Hmmm, same should be for the footer (info-line)
rigorously then?

I just installed r790 from the SVN snapshot, and it appears to have
solved the issues I saw at least, with these settings:

set status_on_top=yes
set help=yes
set pager_index_lines=6

The only thing I see which looks a little odd is that the help and
status lines extend all the way to the left edge of the terminal, but
the parts above and below the sidebar are not used (they are blank,
just the background color from my muttngrc). This is most definitely a
lot better, though.

Thanks, Rocco!
