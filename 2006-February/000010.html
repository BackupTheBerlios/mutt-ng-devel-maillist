Dear Friend,

 
I got your contact on my private search for a reliable
and trusted person to handle a transaction of this
nature. I know that the contents of this mail might
sound so strange, but I want to assure you that every
word of it is true.I am Mr Daniel Chin, credit officer
of the AFC Merchant Bank.I have a concealed business
suggestion for you.Before the plane crash of
Macedonian's President and his Cabinet Members on
February 26, 2004 , our Client Mile Krstevsk from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Macedonia and also a
Business Man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18
calendar months, with a value of Nine Million,Six
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars($9.6Million)
only in my branch.You can visit this website:
 
<A HREF="http://antiwar.com/deliso/?articleid=2043">http://antiwar.com/deliso/?articleid=2043</A>
 
After his death it was also discovered that Mile
Krstevsk did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank
deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he
was at my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my Bank.So, Nine Million,Six Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my
Bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.
What bothers me most is that according to the to the
laws of my country at the expiration of 2years the
funds will revert to the ownership of  the Singapore
Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is
that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to Mile Krstevsk so that you will be able
to receive his funds.
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successfully.I have
contacted an Attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Mile Krstevsk ,all that is required from you at this
stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names
and Address so that the Attorney can commence his
job.After you have been made the next of kin,The
Attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf
and secure the necessary approvals and letter of
Authority in your favor for the move of the funds to
an account that will be provided by you.There is no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to
adopt a legalized method and the Attorney will prepare
all the necessary documents according to the
International Banking Laws.
 
Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all
matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank 
account we shall share in the ratio of 75% for me, 20%
for you and 5%for any expenses incurred during the
course of this operation.Should you be 
interested please send me your private phone and fax
numbers for easy communication, you can write me via
my private box thus:(  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mutt-ng-devel">daniel_chi at gawab.com</A>  )and i will
provide you with more details of this Project.
 
Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,

Mr Daniel Chin.
