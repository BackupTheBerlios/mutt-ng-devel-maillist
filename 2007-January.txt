Subject: header cache question
Message-ID: <20070103121716.GA21616@a5.repetae.net>

Hello,

I have tried to enable the header cache with these configuration
lines:

set header_cache=~/mail/mutt-header-cache
set maildir_header_cache_verify=no

I have a maildir with 16,000 entries. Mutt-ng seems to load the first
10,000 entries quickly, but after that it proceeds very slowly as if
it is not using the cache.

How do I go about troubleshooting this problem?

Many thanks,

Frederik Eaton

- Which database did you tell the compiler to use?
- Is your home a NFS share? A better cache location would be local 
  like /var/tmp/mutt-headers.frederik
- Do you have a quota on your home and the needed space is left?
- Maybe the last 6000 mails are not cached yet and they have to be
  aknowledged by the database first? The second run should be faster
  then.

At least the header_cache feature is a fantastic feature. Maildirs
with about 40.000 mails is no problem. I would choose the qdbm
database, but didn't managed to compile mutt-ng-new with it yet as
you can read in my last post to this list.

It looks like qdbm - at least muttng is linked to that library.

No.

No.

No...

Thanks for your reply. I guess one suggestion would be that muttng
could give more feedback to the user when it is reading a mailbox - is
it reading from a cache? Is it using a slower algorithm because of
some unexpected condition?

For instance, it often seems to do two passes - what are these passes?

Now that you've prompted me to look up the database type, I'm trying
to use qdbm-util to inspect the files. 'dpmgr list' produces what
looks like garbage, but with filenames and addresses and stuff
embedded. Also, I can't tell which index file (of 49) belongs to
inbox. Not really a big deal though, I was just mildly curious.

Anyway, happy new year.

Frederik

You're using an old Debian version. Either update to latest
experimental one or try to build the new one:

I'm now using:

Mutt-ng devel-r804 (based on Mutt 1.5.11/2005-09-15)

This is what 'apt-get install -t experimental mutt-ng' gave me.

The problem isn't fixed at all, loading a mailbox is still very slow.

Should I build from source? What bug was fixed?

Thanks,

Frederik

I would rebuild the database. Delete the cache files/dirs and open
folder by folder. Opening the first time will take some time but
then you'ra probably shure your DB works.
