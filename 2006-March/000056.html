<PRE>Hi list,

Yesterday I decided to implement a long time wish I had for Mutt, and
thus to dive into Mutt-ng's code to see where I could do that.  To cut a
long story short: I managed to do what I wanted.

The reason I post to this list is to see if there is some interest in
what I did, and as a general first time feedback (I hope) on my
&quot;feature&quot;, as well as a discussion on the way it should be done, because
I made some assumptions in my current implementation.

The feature I implemented, I call 'smarttime'.  In short it does a bit
like `ls -la` does when displaying the time, it changes the format based
on how long the time is ago, e.g:
-rw-r--r--    1   4523 12 Aug  2005 muttng-20050809-r1.ebuild
-rw-r--r--    1   4296 11 Mar 10:02 muttng-20060309.ebuild
where the first is so old that it shows the year instead of the time.

I implemented something alike for the $index_format variable, where I
added the sequence %Q within the {[&lt;( time brackets.  The %Q gets
replaced by a valid strftime string based on the value of the time that
is printed and the current time.  An example of &quot;%[%Q] ...&quot; for example
is:
15-Feb ...
15-Feb ...
27-Feb ...
Wed-08 ...
08:33  ...
where %Q is replaced by a 6 char wide string on the following
conditions:
- if the message is in the future: treat as if it were in the past
- if the message was within the last 12 hours: &quot;%k:%M &quot; (08:33 )
- if the message was within the last 7 days: &quot;%a-%d&quot;    (Wed-08)
- if the message was within the last 12 months: &quot;%d-%b&quot; (27-Feb)
- if the message is older than a year: &quot;%b-%y&quot;          (Aug-04)

As can be seen, I made a number of assumptions, especially on the
formatting of the date/time, which not everyone will like.  I thought
about adding %q to for instance deal with am/pm time ( 8:33a), but I
doubt whether that is flexible enough.  So, this is where I'd like to
have some feedback.
I first thought of implementing some conditionals, such that one could
control which 'steps' to include or not, but maybe people don't like the
switch-points I chose.  (I'm not sure on them myself either).  Another
thought was to allow something like %[%H:%M ][%a-%d][%d-%b][%b-%y] such
that people can define themselves how the four representations should
look like.  Comments are appreciated!

Last but not least, please find the patch here:
<A HREF="http://dev.gentoo.org/~grobian/patches/muttng-smarttime.patch">http://dev.gentoo.org/~grobian/patches/muttng-smarttime.patch</A>
It compiles and runs on both my OSX ppc and Gentoo Linux x86 machines.
