<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; How do I go about troubleshooting this problem?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Which database did you tell the compiler to use?
</I>
It looks like qdbm - at least muttng is linked to that library.

&gt;<i> - Is your home a NFS share? A better cache location would be local 
</I>&gt;<i>   like /var/tmp/mutt-headers.frederik
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> - Do you have a quota on your home and the needed space is left?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> - Maybe the last 6000 mails are not cached yet and they have to be
</I>&gt;<i>   aknowledged by the database first? The second run should be faster
</I>&gt;<i>   then.
</I>
No...

&gt;<i> At least the header_cache feature is a fantastic feature. Maildirs
</I>&gt;<i> with about 40.000 mails is no problem. I would choose the qdbm
</I>&gt;<i> database, but didn't managed to compile mutt-ng-new with it yet as
</I>&gt;<i> you can read in my last post to this list.
</I>
Thanks for your reply. I guess one suggestion would be that muttng
could give more feedback to the user when it is reading a mailbox - is
it reading from a cache? Is it using a slower algorithm because of
some unexpected condition?

For instance, it often seems to do two passes - what are these passes?

Now that you've prompted me to look up the database type, I'm trying
to use qdbm-util to inspect the files. 'dpmgr list' produces what
looks like garbage, but with filenames and addresses and stuff
embedded. Also, I can't tell which index file (of 49) belongs to
inbox. Not really a big deal though, I was just mildly curious.

Anyway, happy new year.

Frederik
